Dr. Boulay obtained his PhD in 2011 working under Jon Wolpaw at the (now called)
National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies in Albany, NY. This is where he acquired his passion for analyzing
neurophysiology signals and systems, and realized the larger impact he could have developing tools in this field like
BCI2000. Dr. Boulay currently writes software for invasive brain-computer interfaces for assistive communication 
(for ALS, SCI) and to induce and guide adaptive plasticity (to treat Parkinson's). He specializes in online streaming 
signal processing and decoding. He uses and contributes to open source projects for neurophysiological signal analysis 
and inter-process communication, and is a primary maintainer of LabStreamingLayer, ezmsg, and Blackrock Neurotechâ€™s 
open source tools.
